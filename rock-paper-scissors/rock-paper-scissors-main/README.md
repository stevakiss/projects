Rock Paper Scissors game in HTML and JavaScript

My primary focus on this project was to implement HTML and JavaScript fundamentals. The aim of this project was to create a game of rock paper and scissors against the computer. The user needs to select between three options and the computer selects a choice randomly. The game stops when the user or the computer wins 5 rounds.

The game took 3 days to complete.

Hi guys,

So this is my first project. I started my learning on 21/05/2021 via The Odin Project, this webpage is the output of whatever I have learnt & absorbed during this period. 

I started working on this project on Sunday (14/06/2021- 5:00pm) and I was able to finish it on Monday (15/06/2021- 21:47pm). It took about 8 hours to finish this project.

Challenges I faced, were as folows:-
1. Had a real hard time moving elements on the desired location, but was able to finally position it properly.
2. At the time of making this project, my grasp on CSS concept was not fully developed so had to use google ALOT in order to make this work!
3. An elaboration of 2nd point, I have not fully understood the CSS flexbox & CSS grid, I am planning to learn them more deeply and apply the concept to this webpage and make it more responsive.

What I learnt:-

1. Initially I had a massive Imposter syndrome, in my ability to built this webpage, but as I started to write my code, I surprised myself with my ability to solve problems as and when they showed up.
2. Breaking down the webpage, into its baby components and then building those individual components individually made the work easier and manageable.
